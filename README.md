## Overview


The Automated Self-Checkout Retail Reference Implementation provides critical components required to build and deploy automated self-checkout solutions using Intel速 hardware, software, and other open source software ingredients. This reference implementation provides a pre-configured automated self-checkout pipeline optimized for Intel速 hardware.

Note that this reference implementation is not meant to be a complete solution but is an open source initiative, providing evidence of hardware and software components needed to drive critical components of vision workloads.

## Learn More

-  Follow step-by-step instructions to set up, install, and execute the software in [Documentation](https://intel-retail.github.io/automated-self-checkout/).
-  Engage with the developer and partner communities using the [Intel Developer Zone](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/reference-implementation/ai-computer-vision-checkout.html).

_______________

**Note**: This reference implementation uses Intel速 Deep Learning Streamer (Intel速 DL Streamer), and the following are some of the known issues:

- Once a barcode is detected and decoded, the barcode label text is displayed inside the object even if the barcode is not visible.
- Object detection label overlaps (gvatrack adds its own labels).
